## controls

Keys are mapped according to [these defaults](https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Setup). Xbox-style controllers also have a [default mapping applied](https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64/wiki/Default-Gamepad-Setup).

## netplay

Gopher64 supports netplay (online play with others) via cloud hosted servers. You can also run the server (https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64-netplay-server) yourself on a LAN.

## portable mode

If you would like to keep all the game data in the same folder as the executable, you just need to create a file called "portable.txt" in the same directory as the executable.

## flatpak

If you want to run the flatpak from the command line, you need to add the `--filesystem=host:ro` option, for example:

```
flatpak run --filesystem=host:ro io.github.gopher64.gopher64 /path/to/rom.z64
```
