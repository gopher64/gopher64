# Security Policy

If you're looking to report a security vulnerability, please go to the
[Security -> Advisories](https://github.com/amodm/webbrowser-rs/security/advisories) section, and click on
the `Report a vulnerability` button

What to expect:
* 48hr turnaround to acknowledge the issue
* The closure ETA can be varied depending on the degree of severity and complexity of resolution
* I have nothing to offer as a reward, except a virtual hug :hugs: as thanks for your selfless effort, and
acknowledging your contribution on the release notes.
